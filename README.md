Iron Mining Data Analysis Project
📌 Objective

To analyze iron ore composition, flotation efficiency, and production metrics using Python and Excel, with the goal of identifying patterns that can improve ore quality, reduce impurities, and optimize mining operations.

📂 Project Overview

This project explores real-world iron mining data to understand how different chemical and operational factors influence extraction and production efficiency. Through structured data analysis, the project highlights key drivers that affect ore quality and identifies areas where process improvements can be made.
The analysis was performed using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy) and Excel for initial validation and data inspection.

📊 Key Insights

Iron concentration (%Fe) varies significantly across mining sites, influencing processing cost and product quality.

Silica (%SiO₂) levels show strong patterns, emphasizing the need for impurity control to increase ore market value.

Ore pulp pH strongly affects flotation efficiency, with certain pH ranges consistently improving iron recovery.

Flotation column performance correlates with ore composition, offering opportunities to fine-tune separation processes.

Production efficiency trends uncover optimization pathways, helping minimize waste and improve overall output.

🧠 Summary

This project demonstrates how data analytics can support smarter, more efficient mining operations. By examining mineral composition and process parameters, we identify actionable opportunities to enhance recovery rates and reduce impurities.

This experience strengthened my Python-based analytical skills and deepened my interest in descriptive and predictive analytics for process optimization, especially in industrial domains like iron ore mining.
